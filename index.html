            What We Stand For
            </h4>
            <p>
            At Chinook, music is more than just sound - it's a passion that permeates everything we do. We believe that quality makes a difference. When you listen to a track with crystal-clear sound quality, it's not just something you hear - it's something you feel deep inside. The perfect balance, the nuanced details, the authentic sound - that's what we strive to deliver to every single customer.

            <h4>
            Our Mission
            </h4>
            <p>
            We want to make high-quality music accessible to everyone who shares our passion for great sound. Every file in our catalog is carefully selected to ensure the sound is exactly as the artist intended. We strive to be the music store where both classic favorites and new discoveries can be found in the best possible quality.

            What Drives Us
            </h4>
            <p>
            What really drives us at Chinook is the feeling of helping people experience music the way it's meant to be - with all the details intact, with all the energy preserved, with the entire emotion conveyed. When a customer finds exactly the song they were looking for in a sound quality that makes them smile, that's why we do what we do. Music is universal, but the feeling that perfect sound creates is truly special.

        <h2>Average track length grouped in genres</h2>
        <p>This chart displays the total track length in minutes across different genres in our current catalog. As you can see, genres like Sci-Fi & Fantasy, Drama, Comedy, and TV Shows dominate in terms of total minutes. This doesn't necessarily mean these are our best-selling genres, but rather that our store carries tracks in longer formats - particularly soundtracks from comedy shows, sci-fi & fantasy productions, science fiction series, dramas, and TV shows, which naturally have longer runtimes than typical music tracks.</p>
        <p>Notice how traditional music genres like Rock, Metal, Jazz, and World Music have significantly lower total minutes. This reflects the typical 3-5 minute song format versus the longer soundtrack and show formats. Consider whether there's an opportunity to expand our music offerings in these shorter-format genres to balance our catalog. Could we attract different customer segments by investing more in traditional music genres? Also think about whether our current mix of soundtracks versus music tracks aligns with what our customers are actually searching for.</p>

        <h2>Genre's performance in revenue</h2>
        <p>This chart displays our total revenue in dollars broken down by music genre. Rock dominates our sales with over $800 in revenue, significantly outperforming all other genres. Latin, Metal, and Alternative & Punk follow in the $100-200 range, while genres like TV Shows, Jazz, R&B/Soul, Blues, and Classical generate more modest revenue. Many niche genres like Reggae, Electronica/Dance, Hip Hop/Rap, and World Music show minimal sales figures.</p>
        <p>While Rock is clearly our strongest revenue driver, there's a huge opportunity gap in the underperforming genres. Consider these strategic questions: Could targeted marketing campaigns help boost sales in genres like Hip Hop/Rap or Electronica/Dance that are popular globally but underperforming in our store? Are we missing key artists or albums in these genres that customers expect to find? Could we create genre-specific promotions or curated playlists to introduce customers to our Latin, Jazz, or Blues catalogs? Also notice the disparity between Rock's dominance and everything else - could we be over-relying on one genre? Diversifying our revenue streams across multiple genres could make our business more resilient and reach broader customer demographics.</p>

        <h2>Top 10 artists by revenue</h2>
        <p>Here you can see our top-selling artists measured by revenue. Iron Maiden, U2, Metallica, and Led Zeppelin lead the pack, showing that classic rock and metal are strong sales drivers for Chinook.</p>
        <p>While these established artists generate solid sales, there are many other artists not on this list. Which new or lesser-known artists could we promote to diversify our revenue streams? Could we create themed events or playlists that highlight underexposed artists within genres that already sell well? Also consider whether we could create campaigns that pair emerging artists with our bestsellers to introduce customers to new music.</p>
