        <p>This donut chart illustrates how our catalog is distributed across different music genres, with darker red indicating more tracks available. Rock completely dominates our inventory, making up the vast majority of tracks in our store. Latin, Metal, and Alternative & Punk have moderate representation, while genres like Jazz, TV Shows, Blues, and Classical occupy smaller portions. Many genres including Hip Hop/Rap, Electronica/Dance, World, Sci-Fi & Fantasy, and others have very minimal track counts, appearing as thin slices in the lighter red spectrum.</p>
        <p>This visualization reveals a significant imbalance in our catalog composition. While having a strong Rock collection aligns with our current revenue leader, we're essentially putting all our eggs in one basket. Consider these opportunities: Are we limiting our potential customer base by having such a Rock-heavy catalog? Could expanding our Hip Hop/Rap, Electronica/Dance, or World Music collections attract younger or more diverse audiences? Notice that some genres with very few tracks (like Hip Hop/Rap) also show low revenue - is this a chicken-and-egg situation where customers aren't buying because we don't offer enough selection? Compare this chart with the Revenue by Genre chart - are there genres where we have many tracks but low sales, suggesting quality or curation issues? Conversely, are there genres with relatively few tracks but decent sales, indicating untapped demand we could capitalize on by expanding those sections?</p>
